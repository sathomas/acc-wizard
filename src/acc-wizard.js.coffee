(($, window, document, undefined_) ->
  # undefined is used here as the undefined global
  # variable in ECMAScript 3 and is mutable (i.e. it can
  # be changed by someone else). undefined isn't really
  # being passed in so we can ensure that its value is
  # truly undefined. In ES5, undefined can no longer be
  # modified.
  
  # window and document are passed through as local
  # variables rather than as globals, because this (slightly)
  # quickens the resolution process and can be more
  # efficiently minified (especially when both are
  # regularly referenced in your plugin).
  
  # From http://ejohn.org/blog/ecmascript-5-strict-mode-json-and-more/
  #
  # Strict Mode is a new feature in ECMAScript 5 that allows you to
  # place a program, or a function, in a "strict" operating context.
  # This strict context prevents certain actions from being taken
  # and throws more exceptions (generally providing the user with
  # more information and a tapered-down coding experience).
  #
  # Since ECMAScript 5 is backwards-compatible with ECMAScript 3,
  # all of the "features" that were in ECMAScript 3 that were
  # "deprecated" are just disabled (or throw errors) in strict
  # mode, instead.
  #
  # Strict mode helps out in a couple ways:
  #
  #  *  It catches some common coding bloopers, throwing exceptions.
  #  *  It prevents, or throws errors, when relatively "unsafe"
  #     actions are taken (such as gaining access to the global object).
  #  *  It disables features that are confusing or poorly thought out.
